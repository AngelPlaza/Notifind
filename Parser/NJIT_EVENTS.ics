DESCRIPTION:<p>We have been hosting our organization's Campus Diwali Cel
 ebration the last five years at the NJIT Campus Center Ballroom. Last ye
 ar we had over 300 attendees stopped by our event. Our event is a cultur
 al celebration of the Hindu Festival of Diwali and the Hindu New Year. W
 e have students perform on traditional Indian instruments and sing tradi
 tional songs about the holiday. We also invite guest speakers to deliver
  inspiring speeches. For example\, our guest speaker two years ago moved
  our audience with his experience celebrating this festive holiday on hi
 s own while he was deployed in Afghanistan. The aim of our annual progra
 m is to show the meaning of the biggest holiday of the Hindu religion. L
 ast year we handed out free t-shirts to everyone\, and are planning a si
 milar small gift giveaway for this year. This event is open to all stude
 nts and faculty and we expect a similar turnout to last year.</p>
